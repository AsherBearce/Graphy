# Graphy

## Summary of the app 

My idea for a useful app would be a graphing calculator capable of doing Calculus, and modeling solutions to differential equations. 
This app would probably be useful to students in math or physics classes, and even perhaps even professors / teachers. In general, 
anyone who needs to use mathematical modeling tools. I'll most likely want to use Wolfram Alpha as a way of solving some problems, 
as well. I've also found several expression interpreter libraries. Also, it would most likely be useful if the user could save 
certain graphs or models, so that they can access their work at a later time, once more, perhaps even the ability to save and import 
certain solutions to problems that they've solved or worked on earlier. For navigation, I think either a bottom button navigation, 
or a navigator drawer. I'm leaning more towards the navigation drawer, as I would also like to be able to model complex functions, 
and 3D functions, and I think I'd like to have different screens for these.

## A more detailed explanation

The primary idea of this app is expanding upon a normal graphing calculator. In general, graphing calculators don't do a few things:
* Differential equations
* Complex Numbers
* Derivatives
* Integrals
* 3D - graphing

So, while I probably won't be able to include a few of the things I've listed, I want to at least include the addition of complex 
valued functions, integrals and derivatives. Another idea that I may include later on, is parsing LaTeX from the input. This would 
definitely increase the usability for what I'm assuming would be most of the users of my app. I'd also like to include some user 
interface that allows you to look at various sections of the graph, most likely by scrolling your finger across the screen.
